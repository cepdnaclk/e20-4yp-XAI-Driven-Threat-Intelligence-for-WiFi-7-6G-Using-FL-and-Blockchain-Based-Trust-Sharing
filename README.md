# Optimizing Communication Efficiency and Latency in Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Systems
___

This research focus on addressing the critical challenges of communication overhead and latency in Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning (BFL). The core aim is to develop and validate novel optimization techniques, algorithms, and protocols that enhance communication efficiency, ensure faster model convergence, and improve the system's scalability, while preserving the security and decentralization benefits provided by the blockchain.
