# Explainable AI-Driven Threat Intelligence for Encrypted Wi-Fi 7/6G Traffic Using Federated Learning and Blockchain-Based Trust Sharing
___

This research explores an advanced cybersecurity framework where explainable AI (XAI) models are collaboratively trained using federated learning across distributed devices to detect threats in next-generation wireless networks (Wi-Fi 7 and 6G). Blockchain technology is integrated to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant sharing of threat intelligence and model updates, enhancing both trust and reliability among network participants.
